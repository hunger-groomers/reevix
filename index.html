    <title>Reevix - Digital Marketing & Production Excellence</title>
```

The file I created in the artifact above IS your homepage with:
- **Title**: "REEVIX" (big title)
- **Subtitle**: "The Business Catalyst. Transforming Local Presence..."
- **4 Stats boxes**: 50+ Services, 24/7 Support, 100% Custom, Fast Delivery
- **3 Service Cards**: Digital Marketing, Printing & Production, 3D & Animation

This should be the FIRST page customers see.

**IMPORTANT STEPS:**

1. **Delete or backup your current `index.html`** file from your GitHub repository
2. **Create a NEW `index.html`** file 
3. **Copy the ENTIRE code** from the artifact I just created (scroll up - it's the full HTML code titled "Reevix - Homepage (index.html)")
4. **Save it as `index.html`** in your repository root
5. **Keep your `digital-marketing.html`** file separate (don't touch it)

**Your file structure should be:**
```

├── digital-marketing.html (Digital Marketing page - with 6 detailed services)
├── printing-production.html
├── 3d-animation.html
